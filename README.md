# Altimit Winget Tool
A Winget Tool that will Remove Bloatware and Install Applications for Windows 10/11

<h2>To Use The Program Please Follow These Instructions:</h2>

1. Open PowerShell by searching for "PowerShell" in the Windows Start menu or by pressing the Windows key + R, typing "powershell," and pressing Enter.

	By default, PowerShell has .ps1 execution policies in place that may prevent running .ps1 files. To change the execution policy for the current session, run the following command in PowerShell with administrative privileges: <strong>Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</strong>

2. Navigate to the directory where your .ps1 file is located using the cd (Change-Location) command. For example, if your file is in the "C:\Altimit Winget Tool" directory, run the following command: cd C:\Altimit Winget Tool

3. Run the file by entering its filename preceded by .\. For example, if your file is named "tool.ps1", run the following command: .\tool.ps1


4. PowerShell will execute the file, and you should see the output and results of the file in the PowerShell console.

**NOTE: After running the file, the file will automatically return the execution policy to its original state by running the following command in PowerShell with administrative privileges: Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted

***IF YOU NEED TO RUN THE FILE AGAIN, YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THE EXECUTION POLICY AGAIN BACK TO REMOTESIGNED IN ORDER TO USE***
